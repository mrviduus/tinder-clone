# 🏗️ Technical Design Document (Kid-Friendly Version!)

## 🎯 What We're Building

We're building a **friend-making app** that works like a digital playground where people can safely meet and chat with new friends!

## 🧩 Architecture Overview (The Big Picture!)

### 🏗️ **Three-Layer Castle Design**

```
🎨 PRESENTATION LAYER (What you see)
     ↕️
🧠 BUSINESS LAYER (The smart thinking)
     ↕️
🗄️ DATA LAYER (The memory keeper)
```

Think of it like a three-story house:
- **Top Floor**: Pretty rooms where people hang out (Frontend)
- **Middle Floor**: Smart robots that do all the work (Backend API)
- **Basement**: Giant filing cabinet that remembers everything (Database)

## 📱 Frontend Design (The Art Studio!)

### 🎨 **Technology Choices**
- **React Native**: Like magic crayons that work on any device!
- **TypeScript**: Makes sure we don't make spelling mistakes in code
- **Expo**: Like a helpful assistant that makes building easier

### 🏠 **Screen Architecture**
```
📱 App Shell (The phone frame)
├── 🏠 Home Screen (Card swiping playground)
├── 👤 Profile Screen (Your personal room)
├── 💕 Matches Screen (Friends list)
├── 💬 Messages Screen (Chat rooms)
└── ⚙️ Settings Screen (Control panel)
```

### 🎮 **State Management** (How the app remembers things)
Like having a smart notebook that remembers:
- Who you are (user info)
- Who you've seen (swipe history)
- Your conversations (messages)
- Your settings (preferences)

## 🏰 Backend Design (The Smart Kingdom!)

### 🎯 **Clean Architecture Pattern**
Like organizing a really neat toy box:

```
🌐 CONTROLLERS (The door guards)
    ↓ talk to
🎮 SERVICES (The workers)
    ↓ talk to
🗃️ REPOSITORIES (The librarians)
    ↓ talk to
📦 DATABASE (The memory boxes)
```

### 👑 **Controllers** (The Royal Messengers)
Each controller is like a specialized helper:

```

## 🗃️ Database Design (The Memory Palace!)

### 🏛️ **PostgreSQL with PostGIS** (Super Smart Elephant Brain!)
We chose PostgreSQL because it's like having an elephant that:
- Never forgets anything
- Can find information super fast
- Understands GPS locations (PostGIS magic!)
- Can handle lots of people at once

### 📊 **Tables** (Organized Storage Boxes)

#### 👤 **Users Table** (The ID Cards Box)
```sql
🆔 What we store:
- Unique ID number (like a student ID)
- Email address (their mail address)
- Scrambled password (secret code)
- When they joined (birthday in the app)
```

#### 📋 **Profiles Table** (The Detailed Info Box)
```sql
📝 What we store:
- Display name ("Call me Alex!")
- Birthday (to calculate age)
- Gender (how they identify)
- Bio (their story: "I love puppies!")

- Preferences (what kind of friends they want)
```

#### 📷 **Photos Table** (The Picture Album)
```sql
🖼️ What we store:

- When it was uploaded
- Which user it belongs to
- If it's their main profile picture
```

#### 💕 **Swipes Table** (The Decision Records)
```sql
👍👎 What we store:

```

```sql
📨 What we store:
- Who sent the message
- Which friendship it belongs to
- The actual message text
- When it was sent
- If it was read yet
```

## 🔐 Security Design (The Castle Defense!)

### 🛡️ **Authentication** (Proving Who You Are)
Like having a special badge that proves you belong here:

1. **Registration**: Get your first badge
2. **Login**: Show your badge to enter
3. **JWT Tokens**: Digital badges that expire
4. **Refresh Tokens**: Get a new badge when yours expires

### 🔒 **Authorization** (What You're Allowed to Do)
Like having different colored badges for different rooms:
- 🟢 Green badge: Can see your own profile
- 🔵 Blue badge: Can swipe on people
- 🟡 Yellow badge: Can message your matches
- 🔴 Red badge: Admin powers (super rare!)

### 🛡️ **Data Protection**
- **Password Hashing**: Turn passwords into secret codes
- **HTTPS**: Wrap all messages in invisible envelopes
- **Input Validation**: Check that all information makes sense
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent people from being too pushy

## 🌐 API Design (The Communication Rules!)

### 📡 **RESTful API** (The Polite Conversation Rules)
Like having good manners when talking:

```
🟢 GET /api/users/me          → "Show me my profile"
🟡 PUT /api/users/me          → "Update my profile"
🔵 POST /api/swipes           → "I'm making a swipe decision"
🟣 GET /api/matches           → "Show me my friends"
🟠 POST /api/messages         → "Send a message"
```

### 📊 **Response Format** (How We Answer)
Every answer follows the same pattern:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": "The actual information you wanted",
  "message": "A friendly explanation",
  "timestamp": "When this happened"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (Quality Control Lab!)

### 🔬 **Types of Tests** (Different Types of Checkups)

#### 🎯 **Unit Tests** (Individual Toy Testing)
Test each small piece by itself:
- Does the password checker work?
- Can the photo resizer handle big pictures?
- Does the age calculator do math correctly?

#### 🔗 **Integration Tests** (Team Testing)
Test how pieces work together:
- Can users register AND create profiles?
- Do swipes create matches correctly?
- Can matched people send messages?

#### 🌐 **API Tests** (Full App Testing)
Test the whole app like a real user:
- Register → Create Profile → Swipe → Match → Message
- Try to break things on purpose
- Make sure security works

### 🤖 **Test Automation** (Robot Quality Control)
We have robots that:
- Test everything automatically
- Run tests every time we change code
- Tell us immediately if something breaks
- Keep track of what's been tested

## 🚀 Performance Design (Making It Super Fast!)

### ⚡ **Speed Optimizations**
Like making a race car:

#### 📱 **Frontend Speed**
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load pictures when you need them
- **Caching**: Remember things so you don't have to ask twice
- **Image Optimization**: Make pictures smaller but still pretty

#### 🏰 **Backend Speed**
- **Database Indexes**: Like having a super-organized library card catalog
- **Connection Pooling**: Share database connections efficiently
- **Response Caching**: Remember common answers

#### 🗄️ **Database Speed**
- **Optimized Queries**: Ask the database smart questions
- **Geographic Indexes**: Find nearby people super fast
- **Pagination**: Don't load everything at once

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging (The App's Health Monitor!)

### 📈 **What We Watch**
Like having a doctor check the app's health:
- How many people are using it?
- How fast is it responding?
- Are there any errors?
- Is the database healthy?

### 📝 **Logging** (The App's Diary)
The app writes down everything important:
- When people log in
- If something goes wrong
- How long things take
- Security events

## 🔄 Development Workflow (How We Build It!)

### 🎯 **Agile Development** (Building in Small Steps)
Like building with LEGO blocks:
1. Plan what to build this week
2. Build small pieces
3. Test each piece
4. Show it to users
5. Get feedback
6. Improve and repeat!

### 🌿 **Git Workflow** (Saving Our Work)
Like having multiple save files for a video game:
- **Main branch**: The official game everyone plays
- **Feature branches**: Experimental new levels
- **Pull requests**: Asking permission to add new features
- **Code reviews**: Having friends check your work

## 🎉 Conclusion

This dating app is like building a digital playground where people can safely meet and make friends! Every piece is designed to be:
- **Safe** 🛡️: Like having good security guards
- **Fast** ⚡: Like having a sports car engine
- **Reliable** 🎯: Like having a best friend who's always there
- **Scalable** 🚀: Like having a playground that can grow bigger

The whole system works together like a well-organized school where everyone has a job, everyone follows the rules, and everyone helps make sure kids have fun and stay safe!

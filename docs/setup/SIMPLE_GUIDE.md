# 🎮 My Dating App - Like a Video Game for Meeting Friends!

## 🌟 What is this app?

Imagine you have a magical photo album where you can see pictures of people who want to be your friend. You can say "I like this person" or "Maybe not this time" by swiping on your phone. If two people both say "I like you," they become matched friends and can send messages to each other!

## 🏗️ How is it built? (Like Building with LEGO blocks!)

### 🧱 The Big Pieces

🧠 The invisible brain that remembers everything
💾 Made with C# .NET (like a super smart robot)
🗃️ Stores all the photos, messages, and who likes who
